# webserver_vuln_script

This script was written for a Security Testing assignment and scans the given network range (using nmap), before identifying the hosts that are likely to be a webserver. It then returns the versions of processes running on the hosts, and searches Metasploit for any known vulnerabilities of the versions running.
